Sources for Captain Bearbeard, now on GitHub.  
The IDE was FlashDevelop on Windows.  
  
Most of the sounds were taken from [freesound.org](freesound.org).  
There used to be a background music, but I removed it because we'd need a 
license - credit is not enough. It was "Treasure Cove" by Antti Martikainen.  
To recreate the intended experience, you should search for that music and
play it while... well, playing this game.
