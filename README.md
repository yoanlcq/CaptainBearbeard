The IDE was FlashDevelop on Windows.  
The scene's FPS setting used to be 30 - I ported it to 60FPS recently.

Most of the sounds were taken from [freesound.org](freesound.org).

The background music used to be "Treasure Cove" by Antti Martikainen, but
I replaced it because at the time we did not look that much into the license.
